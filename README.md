# Predicting Red Wine Quality using Machine Learning

This project aimed to predict red wine quality based on physicochemical properties using machine learning models in Python. The dataset contained 1,599 samples of red wine with 12 input variables including alcohol content, pH, sulphates, chlorides etc. 

Multiple machine learning models were developed and evaluated including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks. The data was split into train and test sets for model training and evaluation. Feature engineering techniques like standardization, normalization were applied to preprocess the data. Grid search and cross-validation was used to tune the hyperparameters of each model.

The random forest classifier achieved the highest test accuracy of 95% after hyperparameter tuning. Feature importance analysis identified alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates as the key factors influencing predicted red wine quality.

The models provide a data-driven approach to predict wine quality from physicochemical properties. This can help winemakers select optimal grape varieties and tailor processing methods to achieve higher quality standards. By predicting quality prior to bottling, producers can make early adjustments to improve outcomes.

Overall, the project demonstrated a thorough machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model optimization. It utilized core techniques like cross-validation, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics. The results provide actionable insights that can benefit wine quality assessment and production.
